## 1. Card Description Language

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines p.7

### Approved
- "Credit card"
- "Spend card"
- "Payment card"
- "Card"

### Prohibited
- "Debit card"
- "Prepaid card"

**Why:** Rain-issued cards are credit cards. Describing them as debit or prepaid is inaccurate and creates regulatory issues.

---

## 2. Crypto Connection Language

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines p.8

### Approved
- "Use your crypto for real world spending"
- "Making your crypto usable"
- "Making onchain assets usable in the real-world"
- "Use your digital assets for everyday purchases"
- "Turn your crypto into real-world spending power"
- "Introducing the latest crypto card, trusted worldwide"

### Prohibited
- "Spend your crypto"
- "Pay with your crypto"

**Why:** Users are not directly spending cryptocurrency. They are borrowing against it or converting it — the crypto itself is not being transferred to the merchant. "Spend your crypto" misrepresents the transaction mechanic.

**Watch for:** Variants like "spend against your crypto" are borderline — they imply spending crypto rather than borrowing. Recommend using approved phrasing instead.

---

## 3. Geographic Eligibility Language

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines p.7

### Approved
- "Available in select jurisdictions"

### Prohibited
- "Available worldwide"
- "Available anywhere in the world"
- "Available in [specific number] of countries"
- "Hey [specific country]! The [card name] is now available to you!"

**Why:** Card availability is restricted by jurisdiction. Overstating availability creates legal liability and misleads users.

---

## 4. Card Acceptance Language

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines p.5, p.8

### Approved
- "Use your card anywhere Visa is accepted"
- "Use your card at over 150 million merchants that accept Visa worldwide"
- "Accepted by over 150 million merchants around the world"
- "Use your card in over 150 countries"
- "Accepted anywhere in the world"
- "Accepted everywhere"

**Important:** The "150 million merchants" figure is Rain's approved number. Do not use other numbers (e.g., "100 million merchants"). Using a lower number is not in the approved language.

**Channel restriction:** Visa name can only be used on website, organic social, and PR. For paid/influencer channels, use "accepted at over 150 million merchants" without the Visa name. See Section 11 (Direct Solicitation).

---

## 5. Describing Rain

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines p.9

### Approved
- "Introducing [card name], backed by Rain"
- "Rain powers branded cards backed by stablecoins"
- "Our branded cards are powered by Rain"

### Prohibited
- "Rain is our issuing bank"
- "Rain is our bank partner"
- "Rain is an FDIC insured bank"
- "Rain offers banking services to its customers, including credit cards"

---

## 6. Rain's Relationship with Visa

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines p.9

### Approved
- "Rain is a Visa Principal Member"
- "Rain is approved by Visa to offer cards that operate over their network"

### Prohibited
- "Rain is a Visa partner"
- "Rain is Visa approved"
- "Rain is Visa certified"
- "Rain is built into the Visa network"
- "Visa endorses Rain"
- "Visa powers Rain"

---

## 7. Visa Logo and Brand Usage

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines p.5

### Approved
- Using the Visa logo/name to communicate acceptance (e.g., "Use your card anywhere Visa is accepted")
- Showing Visa logo on the physical card in marketing imagery (organic/website only)

### Prohibited
- Using Visa as a selling point or suggesting endorsement
- "Get a Visa credit card"
- "Backed by Visa"
- "Sign up for a Visa"
- "The [Brand Name] Visa Card" (cannot use Visa as part of the card name)

**Critical:** Visa branding permissions depend on the distribution channel. See Section 11.

---

## 8. Banking Services Language

**Source:** Legal Overview p.3

### Prohibited
- Stating or insinuating Rain-issued cards are backed by a bank or FDIC insured
- Referencing bank or bank services in connection with Rain card unless a separately licensed bank provides the service AND Rain gives explicit approval

---

## 9. DeFi Protocol + Card Separation

**Source:** Legal Overview p.2, DeFi Protocol Integration p.2, p.6

This is one of the most consequential compliance areas. Rain requires strict separation between card product marketing and DeFi protocol marketing.

### Rules

1. **The card CANNOT be shown in the same UI page as the DeFi protocol.** This applies to app screens, landing pages, marketing materials, and videos.

2. **Specific disclaimers are required** when showing the card and the DeFi protocol, even if on separate pages, scenes, or sections. See Section 10.

3. **Explicit Rain permission is required** before showing or connecting the card product to a DeFi protocol in any marketing context.

4. **Yield-bearing deposits cannot be shown on any page that references the card**, including homepage or account overview pages.

5. When the card appears anywhere, an **asterisk (*) with disclaimer** is required (see Section 10).

### What This Means in Practice

- Blog posts, landing pages, and UI pages that mention the card should NOT also describe DeFi lending, yield, borrowing mechanics, TVL, or protocol-specific functionality on the same page.
- Videos must use scene separation — DeFi context and card context cannot appear in the same frame.
- If content must reference both (e.g., explaining how the card works), explicit Rain pre-approval is required, and all disclaimers must be present.

### Common Violations

- Landing page that describes DeFi lending and the card in the same section
- "The card connects to [protocol]'s lending platform" on a card marketing page
- "Your crypto can earn yield AND give you spending access" — combines yield and card
- Showing APY/APR or deposit rates on a page that also has a card CTA
- Video showing DeFi dashboard and physical card in the same shot

---

## 10. Required Disclaimers

**Source:** DeFi Protocol Integration p.3, p.5, p.6

### Short Disclaimer (anytime card is visible or referenced alongside a DeFi protocol)

> "[Card Name] is not affiliated with [Protocol Name] and subject to separate terms provided by Issuer"

This must appear as an asterisk (*) overlay, footnote, or adjacent text whenever the card is shown.

### Full Disclaimer (card terms page, end cards, sign-up flow)

> "The [Card Name] is provided by Issuer pursuant to a license from Visa. Any credit issued by [Protocol Name] is subject to its separate terms and conditions. Issuer is not a party to any agreement with [Protocol Name] and is not responsible for any loan or credit arrangement between user and [Protocol Name]."

### Placement Requirements

- **App UI:** Short disclaimer visible on any screen showing the card
- **Card terms page:** Full disclaimer in card terms
- **Sign-up flow:** Full disclaimer in the agreement flow
- **Marketing materials:** Short disclaimer whenever card is referenced alongside protocol
- **Video:** Short disclaimer as overlay when card is visible; full disclaimer on end card or in video description
- **Website:** Short disclaimer on card sections; full disclaimer in footer or linked terms page

---

## 11. Direct Solicitation Rules

**Source:** Partner Launch Tactics p.13, Partner Marketing Guidelines p.5

Distribution channels are classified as either "direct solicitation" or "not direct solicitation." This classification determines whether Visa branding can be used.

### NOT Direct Solicitation (Visa branding allowed)
- Website / landing pages
- Organic social media posts
- PR / earned media coverage

**Allowed:** May explicitly promote Visa acceptance, use Visa name and logo, show card image with Visa logo.

### Direct Solicitation (NO Visa branding)
- Paid digital advertising
- Paid social media (boosted posts, promoted content)
- Out-of-home (OOH) advertising
- Targeted email campaigns
- Influencer / KOL campaigns
- SMS / push notifications

**Rules for direct solicitation channels:**
- Do NOT use Visa name or logo in copy or imagery
- May show card image with **Visa logo removed**
- May state acceptance generically: "accepted at over 150 million merchants"
- Cannot say "anywhere Visa is accepted" — must remove Visa name entirely

### Production Implication

If content will be distributed across both organic and paid channels (common for video), produce two versions:
1. Organic version — Visa logo visible on card, Visa name in copy
2. Paid/influencer version — Visa logo removed from card, generic acceptance language

---

## 12. Tax and Financial Claims

**Source:** Not present in Rain's approved copy guidelines. Risk category.

### Rule

Rain's approved copy does not include ANY tax-related messaging. The following types of claims should not appear in marketing materials:

- "Skip capital gains taxes"
- "No taxable event"
- "Tax-free spending"
- "Avoid triggering a taxable sale"
- "Access liquidity without triggering a taxable event"
- Any implication that using the card is a tax optimization strategy
- Any reference to the IRS, capital gains, or tax treatment

**Why:** Tax treatment of crypto-backed borrowing varies by jurisdiction and individual circumstances. Making tax claims in marketing materials creates financial/legal liability and is not sanctioned by Rain's approved copy.

**Also watch for:** Comparative financial claims like "better rates than credit cards" or "competitive rates" require substantiation (see Section 13).

---

## 13. Substantiation of Claims

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines p.10

### Rule

All factual claims in marketing materials must be substantiable. If a claim is made (user numbers, transaction volumes, rate comparisons, performance metrics), the partner must be able to provide supporting evidence.

### Common Issues

- "~200k monthly spend" — must have data to back this up
- "Better rates than traditional credit cards" — requires published rate comparison
- "Fastest crypto card" — requires benchmark data
- Any superlative or comparative claim needs evidence

---

## 14. Age Restrictions

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines p.10

### Rule

- Cards are ONLY for users 18+ who have completed KYC
- Marketing must NOT promote card usage by children or teens
- No content, imagery, or messaging targeting minors

---

## 15. Rewards and Points Programs

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines (rewards section)

### Rule

- All rewards programs must be submitted to Rain for review and approval BEFORE going live
- If a points program is mentioned in marketing materials, it must have been approved by Rain
- Rewards structure and terms must be clearly communicated

---

## 16. Connecting to Other Products

**Source:** Legal Overview p.2

### Prohibited (without explicit Rain permission)

- Connecting Rain card to other fintech products (Buy Now Pay Later, deferred purchase products)
- Showing yield-bearing deposits on any page that references the card (including homepage or account overview)

---

## 17. Review Process Requirements

**Source:** Partner Marketing Guidelines p.12, Partner Launch Tactics p.9

### Mandatory Process

1. Submit ALL public-facing marketing materials to **marketingreview@rain.xyz** at least **14 business days** before planned launch
2. Scope includes: websites, ads, social posts, decks, explainer videos, onboarding flows, scripts, storyboards
3. Video scripts and storyboards must be approved **BEFORE production begins** — do not wait until post-production
4. Rain uses compliance monitoring tools for post-launch review
5. Non-compliance may result in: program pause, suspension, or termination
6. Bundle submissions when possible — Rain prefers reviewing everything at once

---

## 18. User Onboarding Requirements

**Source:** US Consumer Onboarding Requirements, International Consumer Onboarding Requirements

### KYC Flow Requirements
- Must collect and verify: Full name, Date of birth, Address, Government ID
- CDD data fields required: Occupation, Salary range, Expected monthly transaction volume, Account purpose
- All agreements must include mandatory checkboxes for user consent
- Must record and retain acceptance of user agreements for every sign-up for **5+ years**

---

## 19. Legal Requirements

**Source:** Legal Overview & FAQs

### Mandatory
- All card agreements must use **Puerto Rico law** (mandatory, non-negotiable)
- Self-Managed US Consumer programs: Cannot liquidate collateral more than once per day (24-hour cycle recommended)
- Rewards programs require submission to Rain before going live

---

## Self-Custody and Product Accuracy Claims

**Not a specific Rain rule, but a compliance risk area.**

When describing how the card works, ensure claims accurately represent the product mechanic:

### Watch For
- "Your crypto stays in your wallet" — if the product requires depositing into a smart contract or lending protocol, this is misleading. "Stays in your wallet" implies no transfer occurs.
- "Never leaves your custody" — smart contract custody ≠ self-custody in a user's EOA wallet
- "Assets stay in your wallet, under your control" — may misrepresent collateral mechanics

### Safer Alternatives
- "Your assets stay on-chain"
- "Your position stays intact"
- "Your holdings stay where they are"
- "Keep your position"

These are accurate regardless of whether assets are in a wallet, protocol, or smart contract — they describe the outcome (position preservation) rather than the custody mechanic.
